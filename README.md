The application can be easily handled even by novice users and its interface is quite user friendly. 
Block-chain technology is getting eminence in the market now a days and it is being used in various 
sectors. This technology can play a great role in decentralizing the health sector.


The healthcare industry has been adopting innovative technologies that allow 
digitalization of health records and automation of clinical processes. The need for 
interoperability across different departments in healthcare requires a seamless data 
exchange inside the system. However, confidentiality and integrity of data are critical 
issues during the process of sharing data across different authorized parties. Hundreds of 
millions of medical records have been compromised in 2016 and the number increases. 
The emerging blockchain technology is a revolutionary mechanism, which ensures data 
integrity and confidentiality inside any system. Some healthcare providers have been 
inclined to implement blockchain technology as it presents a decentralized and encrypted 
way of storing and sharing information.

This emerging technology has a great potential to enhance the confidentiality and 
integrity of Electronic Health Records. In this paper, we conducted a systematic 
literature review to find out the research gaps and future research directions in 
blockchain technology in healthcare research. The literature is analyzed to find 
advantages, disadvantages and challenges of adopting blockchain technology in 
healthcare from people, process technology perspectives.

A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable record of 
data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of 
these blocks of data (i.e. block) are secured and bound to each other using cryptographic 
principles. 

The reason why the blockchain has gained so much admiration is that: 

-> It is not owned by a single entity, hence it is decentralized 

-> The data is cryptographically stored inside 

-> The blockchain is immutable, so no one can tamper with the data that is inside the blockchain 

-> The blockchain is transparent so one can track the data if they want to
